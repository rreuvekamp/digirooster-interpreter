# digirooster-interpreter

Script to generate nicely formatted schedule pages for my university (Hanze).

The script interprets JSON generated by the digirooster.hanze.nl website. Check your browsers' devtools while loading the schedule on that page for the ajax request.
You'll probably want to edit the 'rangeStart' and 'rangeEnd' post values so you'll get the full thing.

This program is used to generate [remi.im/rooster/itv2e.html](https://remi.im/rooster/itv2e.html).
